A lightweight library for reading data from and dumping data to ini-files,
developed for embedded micro-controller environments.

It declares some structure types for mapping your mostly static data
to ini-file sections and entries. When parsing an ini file, only the values
mentioned in the file are updated in your internal data.
You can also dump your entire data structure into an ini file.

Internal data can be accessed as strings, unsigned or signed integers
(char, short, long), as flags in a char or via custom read/write functions.

You define the mapping between ini-entries and internal data as an ini file,
and then uCini_gen.pl will generate the related C-code, including access
functions for non-addressable symbols.

You can connect it to your system by defining an stdio_.h file,
that shall declare a small subset of the standard stdio.h:
FILE_ stdin_ stdout_ stderr_ fopen_ fclose_ fgets_ fputs_ 

This way it's possible to use uCini even in very small systems
without OS / file-system / C-library.
